    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monday is the first day of the summer batch of <a href="http://hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a>. You and about 70 other bright-eyed and bushy-tailed programmers will be starting twelve amazing weeks together.</p>

<p>In addition to the excellent advice that Dave and Nick will give you on day one, here are some ideas to help you get the most out of this awesome experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/ab08782397f8/">Read the rest of the post on Medium...</a></p>

<!--
## Know what you want
You are in Hacker School because you love programming and want to get radically better, but what does that mean, exactly? What skills do you want to leave with? Do you want to go in depth on the fundamentals? Learn a new class of languages? Get comfortable writing bigger apps?

If you don’t have this figured out on day one, that’s OK, but move aggressively to figure it out so you know what projects to pick. Ask other people what they’re working on. Talk to a facilitator. No one will hand you a roadmap here, but they will help you write your own if you ask.

## Maximize your learning per hour
Hacker School is this weird wonderful oasis in your life trajectory where you have no deliverables and no responsibilities to ship code for someone else. Your top priority is becoming a better programmer, so make decisions that maximize your learning per hour (LPH).

Pick projects you have no idea how to do. Investigate non-critical but interesting bugs. Get enough sleep, install Self Control, or do whatever you need to do to sit down and just start coding. Twelve weeks is short. Use each day wisely.

## See the forest for the trees
There’s so much happening every day at Hacker School that it is easy to get caught up in a project that drags on for too long. When your LPH gets low, wrap up the project. It doesn’t have to be done for you to be done with it.

Three months is really short, but that word “months” is just heavy enough that you feel like you have all the time in the world, so it’s easy to take your time and move slowly. Set up smaller milestones—every two weeks worked nicely for me—and check in. Are you where you wanted to be after two weeks? Keep your eye on the big picture.

## People are amazing resources
A wonderful thing about Hacker School is the diversity. And I don’t just mean 35% women, 25% people of color, and 15% international folks, even though those numbers are astounding in the technical community.

Hacker School brings together people who are all at a crossroads in their life. You are united by loving programming and wanting to get better at it, but other than that everyone is all over the map. Some have been programming professionally for years. Some have been working in international espionage. Some love kiteboarding. Some have startup experience, others have worked at big companies. Find out what the people around you know and ask them lots and lots of questions.

That goes for the residents too. Google them before they arrive to get some good question ideas. When they arrive, they’ll be eager to pair and talk about code, but also happy to share the story of their life’s work.

Don’t just limit this to Hacker School. Talk actively to the programmers in your life about what you’re working on. They’ll have an interesting perspective. No programmers in your life yet? Go to meetups in NYC and say hi. If you meet someone you like, get their info and keep in touch with them.

## All feedback all the time
Get all your code reviewed. Ask for feedback on your presentations. Check that you chose a good project before you get started. Ask for suggestions from the people you pair with. You won’t get this unless you ask for it, and if you ask you will get better so, so much faster.

If you don’t come away from the conversation with something concrete to change or try differently next time, invite them to be brutally honest. They may be holding back to spare your feelings! We, as a society, suck at teaching people to give negative feedback in a supportive way and it makes a lot of people nervous.

Above all: have fun, learn lots, and never graduate.

    <link href="http://sursh.github.com/blog/2013/03/26/demo-code-review/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-26T17:35:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sursh.github.com/blog/2013/03/26/demo-code-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A big part of life at <a href="http://hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a> is code reviews. Sometimes facilitators review code but for the most part, it's our super talented peers.</p>

<p><strong>Getting reviewed is really valuable to accelerate learning.</strong> It points unclear parts of your code, and blind spots you didn't know you had. In some of my projects I've implemented things in a brute-force way, and my reviewers have pointed me to data structures or libraries I hadn't yet discovered that allowed me to cut out lots of code.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2V2t1y39271F1b3k0B3D/2013_03_25_codereview.JPG" title="Code review session" alt="A picture of our code review session."></p>

<p>Today Allison (a facilitator) offered a demo code review, so we could see how she thinks about a code review. We went over a Lisp implemented in Python written by <a href="https://twitter.com/nycgwailou">Nick</a>.</p>

<p>The crowd watching was pretty diverse, so everyone took something different away. Some learned about Python, some about the Git workflow, and some about Lisps.</p>

    <link href="http://sursh.github.com/blog/2013/03/25/on-rakefiles-and-rabbit-holes/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-25T15:34:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://sursh.github.com/blog/2013/03/25/on-rakefiles-and-rabbit-holes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR.</strong> I noticed a bug in Octopress. In fixing it, I found a separate, truly spectacular error, and learned a lot of interesting things about bash. I would never have learned so much outside of Hacker School, since it gives me the time and space to open up the box.</p>

<h2>The original bug.</h2>

<p>Octopress' <code>rake preview</code> lets you preview your post in the browser before deploying. It spawns Rack to serve local requests and Guard to watch for file changes. Guard in turn spawns Fsevent to do the actual watching.</p>

<p><code>bash Handy pstree is handy.
$ pstree
...
 | | \-+= 31340 root login -pf sasha
 | |   \-+= 31341 sasha -bash
 | |     \-+= 31430 sasha ruby /.../ruby-1.9.3-p374/bin/rake
 | |       |-+- 31433 sasha ruby /.../ruby-1.9.3-p374/bin/gua
 | |       | \--= 31443 sasha /.../ruby-1.9.3-p374/gems/rb-fs
 | |       \--- 31434 sasha (ruby)
...
</code></p>

<p>But when you <code>crtl-C</code>, Fsevent stays running in the background until you <code>kill</code> it or modify a file in the watched dir. This throws a <code>TCPServer Error</code> if you try to run <code>rake preview</code> a second time. Sad pandas.</p>

<p>Initially I had no idea what was going on here. I've dabbled in Ruby but not modified a Rakefile before. I learned <code>ps</code> and <code>kill</code> ten years ago, but didn't know much about what was going on under the hood. Ripe conditions for learning a ton.</p>

<p><strong>This is what I love about Hacker School</strong>. I have the time and space to go down these rabbit holes. At a startup, priority goes to shipping code. <strong>Here, shipping code is the means, not the end.</strong></p>

<p>In the end, the actual bug was pretty small: when you interrupt <code>rake</code>, it passes <code>kill 9</code> to guard. Guard ends itself but doesn't properly terminate its child process fsevent`.</p>

<p>``` ruby Rake preview catching interrupts
  trap("INT") {</p>

<pre><code>[guardPid, rackupPid].each { |pid| Process.kill(9, pid) rescue Errno::ESRCH }
exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>This can be duct-taped together by sending <code>3</code> (QUIT) instead of <code>9</code> (KILL) to Guard, but we're asking the Guard team if this is a known issue. But it gets better!</p>

<h2>Curiouser and curiouser</h2>

<p>Things got <em>really</em> weird when I was playing around with the different exit codes. The Ruby documentation says that if you pass <code>kill</code> a negative argument, it will kill the entire group of processes, not just the child process. Promising!</p>

<p>However, it broke very spectacularly. If you want to follow along, grab the development branch of Octopress, currently 2.1:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone -b 2.1 https://github.com/imathis/octopress.git
</code></pre>

<p>Find the <code>preview</code> task and change the message it passes on interrupt from 9 to -3:</p>

<p>``` ruby Line 161 as of this writing
  trap("INT") {</p>

<pre><code>[guardPid, rackupPid].each { |pid| Process.kill(-3, pid) rescue Errno::ESRCH }
exit 0
</code></pre>

<p>  }
```</p>

<p>Then run <code>rake preview</code> (you will have to run <code>rake install</code> the first time). Wait until you see Guard's prompt (powered by Pry):</p>

<pre><code>16:10:05 - INFO - Guard is now watching at '/Users/sasha/code/octopress'
[1] guard(main)&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Then Control-C. You will see some lines of error output, and then BOTH guard and bash's prompt, instead of one or the other. Wat!</p>

<pre><code>[2] guard(main)&gt; SASHAs-MacBook-Air-2:octopress sasha$ 
</code></pre>

<p>Weird! Press any key that sends input. PRY EXPLODES. Press enter and you get a bash prompt back, but now you can't see anything you type. It's still getting to bash (try <code>ls &lt;enter&gt;</code>) but some things, like control-L, no longer work.</p>

<p>Lolwut?</p>

<h2>Down the rabbit hole</h2>

<p>So I started reading about <a href="http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/">TTY</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal">POSIX signals</a> and using <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?stty">stty</a>. Interesting stuff, particularly the history of our terminal evolving from ticker tape outputs.</p>

<p>You can also change all sorts of wacky things about your terminal with <code>stty</code>. Try <code>stty -echo</code> (<code>stty echo</code> to undo it). This explains why I wasn't able to see my own typing after the Pry explosion - when control was reluctantly handed back to bash, the flags on my terminal weren't properly reset, including the flag to use raw (non-canonical) input processing, which is why it won't process things like <code>control-l</code> until you hit enter.</p>

<p>I didn't find all the answers in my reading, but I'm asking <em>significantly</em> better questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How groups are being used is unclear. I expected the process group to inherit its gid from the parent process and to be killed cleanly by passing a negative argument to <code>kill</code>, but that didn't work. Passing <code>-3</code> kills Rack but only mortally wounds Guard.</p></li>
<li><p>One remaining mystery: why is the bash prompt printed to the terminal after the Guard prompt when Guard is still running? Maybe control is passed from Guard to bash and then back to Guard?</p></li>
<li><p>It seems that Pry is getting something unexpected from its stdin, which triggers its explosion, which may or may not be coming from bash. But how to intercept it?</p></li>
<li><p>The Readlines library defines some bash shortcuts, like mapping <code>ctrl-l</code> to <code>clear</code>, but lets you override them with an .inputrc. So you can do awesome things to your prompt like adjusts how <code>ctrl-w</code> works. There are also vim and emacs modes for bash.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Stuff I learned:</strong> a little Ruby, Rakefiles, POSIX signals, the history of TTY, more about stdin, stdout, and stderr, stty, working with pids, gids, and the Process module in Ruby. And my first accepted (albeit one-character) pull request of Hacker School, which is certainly the highest learning-to-LOC ratio I can think of.</p>

    <link href="http://sursh.github.com/blog/2013/03/07/crashing-heroku-or-when-memory-management-in-python-really-matters/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-07T18:24:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sursh.github.com/blog/2013/03/07/crashing-heroku-or-when-memory-management-in-python-really-matters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/maxlikely">David</a> and I paired this week to build a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/06/markov-and-you.html">Markov chain generator</a>. It analyzes 15MB of old Hacker News headlines and generates completely new headlines that really sound like they came from HN. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/HackerNewsOrNot">follow the Twitter bot</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sursh/markov-hacker-news">check out the code</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.sashalaundy.com/blog/2013/03/05/help-us-plug-our-memory-leaks/">Last time</a>, we asked your advice on how to handle all possible trigrams in 15 MB of seed text - a task that took up about 1 GB of memory in our first implementation, rapidly blasting through Heroku's limit of 512 MB. The culprit? <strong>Dictionaries.</strong></p>

<p>Our initial data structure was a dict of dicts. The key was a <em>bigram</em>, or word pair, and the value was a dict of all of the words that followed that bigram in the training text and the number of times they occured. Wat? Here's an example:</p>

<p>``` python Our initial data structure</p>

<p>{
  ('how', 'to'): { 'do': 529,</p>

<pre><code>               'grow': 202,
               'know': 134,
               .....
             },
</code></pre>

<p>  ('to', 'do'): { 'the': 1245,</p>

<pre><code>              'everything': 149,
              .....
            },
</code></pre>

<p>  ...
}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>With 15 MB of training text and so much redundancy, this can get out of hand quickly! Every word appears <em>at least</em> 3 times in the matrix, and some appear thousands of times.</p>

<h3>Possible solutions:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Generators.</strong> for iterating over the headlines. This helped a lot - got us from 1.3 G down to about 850 MB.</li>
<li><strong>Compression.</strong> Tossing out common values, like <code>1</code> for the count of the long tail of words.</li>
<li><strong>Creative use of data types.</strong> E.G. storing words as <code>int</code>s instead of <code>string</code>s.</li>
<li><strong>Lists.</strong> They take up less memory than dicts. One variation that we tried (and is in <a href="https://github.com/sursh/markov-hacker-news/blob/e584ef95ade08f03a482debfc0c0f47adde67af3/trigrams.py">this version of our code</a>) is creating two dicts of lists rather than one dict of dicts.</li>
<li><strong>Trade memory for speed.</strong> Darius, a Hacker School alum, pointed us to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327223/memory-efficient-alternatives-to-python-dictionaries/327295#327295">his Stack Overflow answer</a>, where he laid out a few other approaches that mainly trade memory usage for speed. Also, David dug up some recent papers that focus entirely on this problem. Researchers are currently doing some very clever algorithms to get the most out of their data structures.</li>
</ul>


<h3>So where did we leave it?</h3>

<p>Darius' suggestions and the approaches in the literature will certainly help reduce memory usage. We wanted to maximize learning per unit of time at Hacker School and didn't think implementing these approaches teach us proportionally more than reading about them. We shipped it by deploying on a machine with more memory. Follow the Twitter bot <a href="https://twitter.com/HackerNewsOrNot">here</a>!</p>

<h4>Stuff I learned along the way:</h4>

<p> Generators, classes and methods in python, pickle, regex, defaultdict, Tweepy, Buffer's API, how bad the built in titlecase methods are in Python, some clever way to handle default arguments, some fundamental principles of NLP.</p>
