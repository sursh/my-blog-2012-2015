[My talk at Pycon on April 11, 2015.](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/394/)

## Abstract

Software engineers are never done learning as our field is always changing. We are always beginners at some things and experts at others. Along the way from beginner to expert we ask a lot of questions, but it can be intimidating to ask for help. There are some common mistakes experts inadvertently make that make people feel self-conscious and stupid for getting help, when asking for help is actually the best thing they could do!

This talk will be split into two halves: giving and then getting technical help. It will give you concrete tools and tips for asking for help, and give you a checklist to see if you’re currently making any of these common mistakes when it’s your turn to answer questions. Improve your communication skills, get along better with your coworkers and colleagues, and learn faster than ever.

## Video

I'll post the video as soon as it's available. 

## Slides

Slides will be posted after the talk.

My slides tend to be sparse and visual. I recommend watching the video.  

## References & Inspiration

I'll also post some of the links and writings that inspired me and helped shape my thinking on this topic. There was also a lot that wouldn't fit in a half hour, so I'll post some of those as well.
