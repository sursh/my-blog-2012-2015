### TODAY: [HOWTO Make Your Future Data Scientist Love You](data-vitals)
O'Reilly Strata & Hadoop World in San Jose, CA, February 2015. 

TK put the abstract here!

New and improved!

### Upcoming: PyCon in Montreal, Canada, April 2015. 
"Your Brain's API: Giving and Getting Technical Help." In our "RTFM" technical culture, it can be scary to ask for help. Likewise, it can be easy to be a jerk accidentally when helping others. In this talk I'm going to share some do's and don'ts things I learned from teaching high school physics and neuroscience for five years, from seminars in my male-dominated college major, from Hacker School's wonderful learning environment, and from some great mentors and teachers in the tech industry.
