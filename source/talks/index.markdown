## Upcoming Talks

### Strata in Santa Clara, CA, February 2015. 
I will be giving a new-and-improved version of "HOWTO Make Your Future Data Scientist Love You."

### PyCon in Montreal, Canada, April 2015. 
"Your Brain's API: Giving and Getting Technical Help." In our "RTFM" technical culture, it can be scary to ask for help. Likewise, it can be easy to be a jerk accidentally when helping others. In this talk I'm going to share some do's and don'ts things I learned from teaching high school physics and neuroscience for five years, from seminars in my male-dominated college major, from Hacker School's wonderful learning environment, and from some great mentors and teachers in the tech industry.
