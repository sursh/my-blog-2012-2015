Last week, I gave a talk at Strata, O'Reilly's data science conference. I've given a number of talks in the past few years and each time I learn a little something new, either in the preparation or the delivery. 

There's been a lot written about how to propose talks and prepare your slides, but less written about preparing right before your talk. Here's what I've figured out works best for me. I'd also really love to [hear from you](http://twitter.com/sashalaundy) about how you prepare for talks!

Part of my motivation for a behind-the-scenes post like this is that beginners compare polished final products to their own messy work. It is important to know that behind every polished talk there is no magic, just work! Messy work. And lots of practice.

So here is my messy work. Here are some things I did this time that worked well. 

- I signed up to give the talk beforehand at a different conference in my home town. This forced me to prepare months ahead of time and I was able to gather some helpful feedback. This is a GREAT idea and I plan to do it for my upcoming PyCon talk. 

In the 24 hours before the talk, here's how I practiced:

- I went through my old slides, cutting excess and rearranging them to fit in a smaller timeslot. 

- The second I was done with that, I did a **live runthrough**! Without further ado or fiddling with slides, I just started talking. There were some rough spots but are never as many as I expect, which feels really good! (A large part of being prepared is managing your own emotions.)

- I used Keynote to **record** this runthrough, which is very easy to do. I love Keynote. I then listened to it and jotted down notes of things to change, transitions that are rough, and slides that need to be adjusted or removed.

- At this point, I paid closest attention to the **transitions**. If I made a slide I probably know what goes on it, but what goes between it and the next one is sometimes rough at this stage. I like each slide to be set up by my words before it comes on. I sometimes leave notes to myself in all caps in the presenter notes so these are there just in case I brainfart on stage. Usually this is a cue rather than a sentenceâ€”just a few words. 

- When I did this rough runthrough, I did it standing and with my clicker. I tried to **picture the conference room** in front of me. That way, it's not as surprising to walk up there on stage and I could be nice and calm during the real thing.

- I made sure I knew how to get **presenter tools** to appear when I plug my computer into the big screen. Hint: you need to know the menu-bar-dragging trick in Display Preferences. 

- I wrote a little stickie that said 'TALK SLOWLY :)' and put it next to the keyboard on my laptop

- I made PDF copies and put **backups** in Dropbox, just in case my dog ate my laptop on the way to the conference.

- I made a **[quick little landing page](/talks/data-vitals)** for the talk. I pointed to it from the most recent blog post and a pinned tweet so people could find it easily from sasha.io, and bookmark it during the talk. I added stuff to it right after the talk.

- And of course, I [power posed](tk) :)

This is what I've found to work for me for prepping in the 24 hours before the talk. What works for you?
