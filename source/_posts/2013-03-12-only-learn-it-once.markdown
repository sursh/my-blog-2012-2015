Hacker School is short! It's just 12 precious weeks. I'm very conscious of making the most of my time here. One strategy I'm trying out is ["only touch it once"](https://www.google.com/search?q=only+touch+it+once&aq=f&oq=only+touch+it+once) from handling email.

of your time here. basic tenet of productivity is only touch it once. link to zenhabits. likewise, you should only learn it once. 

programming hash some big concepts and skill,s but also has tons of minutia. thaty  udon't use every day, but really lslow you down if you have to look them up every time. wouldn't it be cool to learn them toh first time you see them?

need to know something about brains. the first time you think about something, that's encoded in some pattern of activity. certain connections between neurons are stimutaletd. but should your brain keep it?

if it's something that you'll only use once, why bother? brains have a natural way of getting rid of old info. if those pathways aren't stimulated again, they get overwritten and used for other things. 

but if you think the same thoughts over and over again, the repeated activity sets a molecular process in place that cements and strengthens those connections to make them more permanent. 'use it or lose it' (raises interesting corollaries about bad habits)

you read about a cool new thing. like `sudo !!`. you're like 'oh that's going to be so useful later.' fast forward several weeks, and those pathways are weak. you can't reasonably expect your brain to remember syntax, flags, and other factoids after seeing them only once. you need to reinforce tehm.

i've been using anki to short-circuit this procuss as i go thorugh hacker school. each time i finda new factoid, whetehr it's on python or C or git or bash, i add a card to my deck. it's critical to have the discipline to do this as you go - remember, only learn it once! 

then, review according to a [variable training schedule]. I'm plyaing with my morning routine - studying is a good way to get my sleepy brain into programming gear. 

it's only in week 5, but it's been extremely helpful at speeding me up. i rarely have the 'oh yeah, how do you do that again?' moment about something i just learned.
