A year ago today, I started Hacker School. I've learned a remarkable amount since then. And not just concepts, programming languages, and other material. I've fundamentally changed the way I think about learning. 

Hacker School is a remarkable place because it is such a radical rethinking and paring down of a school. Schools historically have been a combination of a curriculum (a list of topics to study and skills to master) and the surrounding environment (physical plant, classmates, teachers, culture, neighborhood, etc). In an era of "innovation" in education focusing entirely on packaging a college's curriculum for distribution in an arbitrary environment, Hacker School goes the other way. They create a remarkable and carefully crafted culture with arbitrary curricula. 

Hacker School teaches you how to learn, regarded as a skill that you can pack up and take with you when you leave. If you learn this well, you never stop learning, so do you ever really leave the school? Their slogan "Never Graduate" is apt. 

Learning how to learn requires an honest evaluation of where you are, an idea of where you want to end up, and understanding what you need to do to get there. In order to grow people as programmers, you need a thoughtful inventory of skills a good programmer might possess. The faculty wrote a thorough (and slightly overwhelming) list [here](). 

Hacker School also taught me to tackle hard things that I know nothing about. Much can be gained from going orthogonal to the beaten path. I didn't full internalize this advice until the well into our batch, but it has served me well since. 

Another crucial/precious habit of mind is to not rely on documentation for questions, but to crack open the source code. They encourage us to "open the black box" and see how it works. This has the obvious benefit of improving our code reading skills, but has a more subtle and powerful impact. If that magical, complex tool is just code that you can read and understand, then you can make other magical, complex tools yourself. One line at a time. 

- get a mental model of your code. better able to tell the difference between typo bugs and bugs where i'm fundamentally misunderstanding something
- talking to other people speeds you up radically. stops you from going down the wrong road. gets you unstuck. shows you bits you didn't know you didn't know. 
- environment is everything. programming is a mode of thought that rewards certain behaviors, like being detail oriented. but when you port that over to social interactions, you are not so rewarded. social rules stop people from accidentally being jerks. moves the environment from an implicitly gendered one of the greater programming community where people bluff and don't reveal weakness, to one that is more neutral, friedly, and productive. really hard to overstate the profound effect on growth. I'd love to see companies use these rules as tehir company grows. i think the'll see a big impact on their engineering teams, both on who they can hire and retain and also on the growth of existing employees. 


add to blofg post: i've learned to more effectively evaluate what I don't know. I'm more aware of my own ignorance. both a blessing and a curse. doesn't help with impostor syndrome


Images: 
- commit history from cole's tweets? go back a year in cole's tweets, i think he sent me a screenshot
- commit history screenshot with hacker school time circled. the commit story says it all. my profile was pretty much all white squares until hacker school started. 
- panorama of the talks?


Why should anyone care about this article? <- use that to generate a better title.
