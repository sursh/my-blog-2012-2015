A big part of life at [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com) is code reviews. Facilitators review code but for the most part, it's our super talented peers. 

**Getting reviewed is really valuable to accelerate learning.** It points unclear parts of your code, and blind spots you didn't know you had. In some of my projects I've implemented things in a brute-force way, and my reviewers have pointed me to data structures or libraries I hadn't yet discovered that allowed me to cut out lots of code.

Today Allison (a facilitator) offered a demo code review, so we could see how she thinks about a code review. We went over a Lisp implemented in Python written by [Nick](https://twitter.com/nycgwailou). 

The crowd watching was pretty diverse, so everyone took something different away. Some learned about Python, some about the Git workflow, and some about Lisps.
