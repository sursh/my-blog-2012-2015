I should really have switched to vim ten years ago when I first started using the command line. But vim has a hell of a hill to get over, and I never made it high enough to keep going. I'm revisiting it because I love keyboard shortcuts! Once they're in your brain, you hardly have to think to move the whole program around at a blazing speed. Then you get to feel like a wizard. 

Starting August 1, I deleted my symlink to `subl` and went cold turkey. It's slowed me down pretty significantly, but that's been a great incentive to set aside time every day to learn new vim stuff, and investing in the tools you use all day every day is always a great investment. I still feel pretty clumsy, but I now find myself editing non-code things in vim! Which is a good sign!

## Resources I'm Using

- I've been working my way through [Practical Vim](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356980/), which is great at getting you *thinking* in the vim way. I suspect this will make me effective much faster than just googling for things as they come up. 

- When I want to look something up on the fly, Google usually points me to the [Vim tips wiki](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/), which is *encyclopedic* for one-off solutions and quick fixes, even if they're not well contextualized.

- I've been pestering my colleagues, developer friends, and other Hacker School folks for their favorite config and tips and tricks, which has been very fruitful.

ALSO, I bought the domain thedailyvim.com, and am considering setting up a daily tips feed there. [Send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/SashaLaundy) if that's something you'd be interested in!
